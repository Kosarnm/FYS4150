Computational Physics

## Project 1:
The goal for this project is to solve the general one-dimentional Poisson equation with
two different numerical methods and compare with the exact analythical solution.

## Project 2:
Implementation of the Jacobi rotation algorithm to solve eigenvalue problem for one and two electrons in the Schr√∂dinger equation.
