Computational Physics

### Project 1:
The goal for this project is to solve the general one-dimentional Poisson equation with
two different numerical methods and compare with the exact analythical solution.

### Project 2:
Implementation of the Jacobi rotation algorithm to solve eigenvalue problem for one and two electrons in the Schr√∂dinger equation.

### Project 3 :

In this project I build a flexible and easily expandable object oriented
framework which I use to simulate the solar system. In order to calculate
orbits of celestial bodies I implement the Euler-Cromer and the Velocity
Verlet numerical integration methods. The Verlet method proves superior.
The model is expanded gradually from a two-body system to include all
planets of the solar system.

### Project 4:

The aim of this project is to determine the Curie temperature Tc,
of a system undergoing phase transitions. When the temperature is
raised above this critical level a ferromagnetic material will change into
a paramagnetic material. The aim is to solve the problem employing the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Monte Carlo methods.


### Project 5 :

In this project I develop a Molecular Dynamics simulator to calculate the macroscopic quantity of melting
temperature from a microscopic system, using periodic boundary conditions. A method is developed to place unit
cells of an argon crystal in a lattice, iterate the system forward with the velocity verlet method and Lennard-Jones
potential and gather statistics.
